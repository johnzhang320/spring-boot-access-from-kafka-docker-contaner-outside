 
# Spring boot connect AWS EC2 Kafka docker container

# Key Points
 1. External same host and external different host ways for spring boot application connect to kafka container
 2. External same host: in local machine, spring boot from outside of docker to connect kafka/zookeeper docker container
 3. External different host: we create AWS EC2 kafka/Zookeeper docker container, spring boot from my local machint to connect
 4. I choose bitnami kafka and zookeeper image because the sizes are small enough to run in EC2 t2.small (t2.micro is not enough)

# EC2 Docker Install and Kafka Docker Compose
 We ommitted install docker and create kafka/zookeeper container in external same host, you can use the docker-compose.yml to test 
 this scenario in your local machine.
 
## Here we mainly focus on external different host scenario: AWS EC2 kakfa Docker Container
 
 Creating EC2 instance will not be described here, we only talk two points about EC2 instance:
 First, you'd better set Elastic IP which will keeps your instance public IP stable otherwise restarting instance changes IP frequently
 Second, runnning kafka/zookeeper in docker may need 1 more GB memory, t2.micro is less than 1GB, I experienced the memory not enough error.
 so choose t2.small, you get 2GB memory.

## Associate your Elastic IP 
  Go "EC2 dashboard" -->"Elastic IPs"-->"Allocation Elastic IP address"-->check "Amazon's pool of IPv4 address"--> "Allocate" button
  After allocat elastic IP, directly click Instance Id (e.g i-05ba8d281c51d19c6) --> click on "Public IPv4 address" --> click on 
 "Associate Elastic IP Address"
  
## Select 2GB memory
  Choose your instance-->Press "Action"-- "Stop instance"-->once it is stopped, press "Action"-->"Instance Setting"-->"Instance Type"
  -->In "type" selection drop down-->scroll down, select "t2.samll"-->restart the instance

## Install Docker 
 
 SSH Login in your EC2 instance --> run following command in SSH terminal:
 
     sudo yum install docker
     sudo systemctl enable docker.service
     sudo systemctl start docker.service

## Configure EC2 instance VPC
  
  You need to configure your network to allow external clients to be able to reach the kafka container in EC2 instance from outside
  
  select your instance --> click on "Security" tab--> click your security group such as 03af811ab4da2764b --> "Edit Inbound Rules"-->
   
  open kafka port number 29092 as 0.0.0.0/0 to guarantee extenal clients reach --> open zookeeper 2181 just in case for multi node cluster

## EC2 Node Address and Setting in Spring Boot Code
	  Public IPv4 A.B.C.D 
	  Public Node Address A.B.C.D:29092
	  Private Address: 172.31.24.237 (for example, you change to your own private IP here , which is useful multi brokers cluster)  
  
## Change Spring Boot Boostrap Server Address   
  Suppose your instance public IP is 53.23.54.207, here A.B.C.D should be 53.23.54.207, you need to use this IP address replace "BOOSTRAP_
  SERVER" variable in ..../config/Constants.java, see "Spring boot Application".
    
# Configure Docker Container
 For two scenarios, I created two docker-compose.yml which shows on below links:
  
  [external-same-host-docker-compose/](https://github.com/johnzhang320/spring-boot-from-outside-access-kafka-docker-contaner/blob/main/external-same-host-docker-compose/docker-compose.yml)
  
  [external-different-host-docker-compose/](https://github.com/johnzhang320/spring-boot-from-outside-access-kafka-docker-contaner/blob/main/ec2-external-different-host-docker-compose/docker-compose.yml)
  
  
  
## volume setting
  Bitnami Image runs in user-mode, actually User_ID 1001, to persist Kafka and Zookeeper data to your host file system, you have to
  map two directories to docker containers, suppose you have two directories /zookeeper and /kafka , running following command
    sudo chown 1001.1001 /zookeeper/
    sudo chown 1001.1001 /kafka/

## zookeeper in docker-compose.yml 
   ZOO_SERVER_ID is assigned to every node in kafka cluster, if we only use one node, it is 1

## kafka in docker-compose.yml    
   KAFKA_BROKER_ID is the unique identifier of the Kafka instance, if you have two nodes in your cluster, first broker KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1
   second one KAFKA_BROKER_ID=2
   KAFKA_CFG_NUM_PARTITIONS is set here to 1 by default, but in real applications you should create topics with many partitions
   
## kafka listner configuration     
   Many places introduce the kafka listener , kafka advertise listener and listener protocol map, here we ommitted detail, 
   especially it was confused with me that confluent kafka image allows to costumize any listner names, such as EXTERNAL_SAME_HOST , 
   EXTERNAL_DIFFERENT_HOST, INTERNAL so on so forth.
   
   However, Bitnami Kafka container applying those meanful listener names always throw following exception:
   
         java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: inter.broker.listener.name must be a listener name defined 
         in advertised.listeners. The valid options based on currently configured listeners are INTERNAL,EXTERNAL_SAME_HOST
  
   I try many times, found Bitnami default accepts those listener names:PLAINTEXT, CONTROLLER, EXTERNAL, using those names actually 
   avoided above inter.broker.listener.name's exception:
   
        - KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT
        - KAFKA_CFG_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:19092,EXTERNAL://0.0.0.0:29092
        - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka-services:19092,EXTERNAL://ec2-A-B-C-D.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:29092
        
## Run docker-compose.yml
   Either in your EC2 SSH terminal, vi docker-dompose.yml and then copy-paste ./ec2/external-different-host-docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
   or upload by scp -i your_keypair.pem  docker-compose.yml to EC2 instance
   Change those A-B-C-D entire DNS name with your public IP address or dns name
   
        sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --remove-orphans
        

## Create Topic before runng spring boot  
  Although KAFKA_CFG_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE=true and in Spring boot bean create topic as well, somehow confleunt or bitnami, they cause
  Spring boot application waiting for create topic forever
  
  in your local, ensure your install kafka and set kafka home directory in .bashrc or .bash_ptofile file

     $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server ec2-A-B-C-D.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:29092 --replication-factor 1 â€”
     partitions 1 --topic OrderTopic
     
 Create this topic is also testing to reach EC2 Kafka Container
  
# Spring boot Application  

  Running in local Intellij and set Bootstrap-server in config/Constants.java
  
        public interface Constants {
            public static final String TOPIC_NAME="OrderTopic";
            public final String GROUP_ID_CONFIG="myGroup";
            // run kafka container in local remove comment
            // public final String BOOTSTRAP_NAME="localhost:29092";  
            // run kafka container in EC2 replace below DNS as your EC2 instance DNS
            public final String BOOTSTRAP_NAME="ec2-A-B-C-D.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:29092";

       }
# Running Spring boot application in PostMan
 After reaching EC2 to create Topic and changing boostrap-server in Constants.java, start Application.java in Intellij
 ensure no issue, go to PostMan, set POST and copy below URL to 'address' and data to 'request body'. running kafka 
 producer and consumer event driven code
 
        POST
